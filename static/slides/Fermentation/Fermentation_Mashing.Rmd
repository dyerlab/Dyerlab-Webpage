# Amylase Enzymes

For brewing there are two prominent amylase enzymes:  

- $\beta$-amylase  

- $\alpha$-amylase

# Sugar Conversion Efficiency

What we are going to do today is look at the way that each amylase enzyme influences the final quality of the fermentation product (e.g., the beer).

For this we will divide the crushed grain into two groups, the $\alpha$ group & the $\beta$ group.

  **Group $\alpha$:** Heat strike water to 145 °F  
  **Group $\beta$:** Heat strike water to 158 °F.  

Each group will mash-in and maintain that temperature .footnote[*n.b.*, you may see a bit of temperature loss when you mash in, so bring the heat back up.].

Both groups will maintain conversion for 45 minutes and then lauter off the sweet wort.

# Outcomes

We can quantify the differences that we see by:  

- Sending samples over to HPLC to look at differential sugars, and/or  

- Thowing some yeast at the situation and fermenting the samples.
