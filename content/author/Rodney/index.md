Rodney Dyer research interests include understanding how landscape configuration and alteration influence connectivity amongst native and introduced species.  This interest has led him develop expertise in theoretical and applied population & landscape genetics as well as developing novel methodologies and statistical tools necessary for understanding the spatial and ecological distribution of population genetic structure.
