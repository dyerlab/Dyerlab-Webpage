  Environmental Research Advisory Committee meeting<br /> Virginia Transportation Research Council
</h1>

The spring meeting of the VDOT ERAC is this week and Bonnie and I will be going to provide some feedback on what we've been doing on the project the last two months (it is pretty early yet, we are just getting going).  Should be fun, lots of cool other projects being presented.  See the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mE_sGSiaN_0vKbz0aZfg50DjbsjCagsp5DQMu6mak44/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) below the fold.
