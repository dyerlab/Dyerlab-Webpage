Today I gave a guest lecture in ENVS102.  Here are the [slides](/slides/ENVS102/Dyer.html).  This is the second semester of our our introductionary series for all incoming students.  The overall impetus here is to provide a bit of background on a researcher, some research directions, and the comments on the ENVS degree.
