There are several reasons why I am doing this:

  1. I don't seem to update too often if I hand code it making my lab webpage rather stale.
  2. Syndication and federation of posts can add dynamic content from lab members to the site.
  3. I'm moving towards this approach in teaching as well so I thought I would eat [my own dogfood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).

We will see how it goes.  Lots of stuff to add and go over.
