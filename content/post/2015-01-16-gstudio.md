This is the main package that provides data types and routines for spatial analysis of genetic marker data. The previous version is currently available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) and you can install it rom within your R environtment by invoking the command

<tt>install.packages("gstudio")</tt>

If you want to keep up with the latest developments of this package, you can use the version found on GitHub.  Install it from within R as:

<tt>require(devtools)<br /> install_github("dyerlab/gstudio")</tt>

and that should get you up-to-date.  You'll need to have a fully working LaTeX install and some other stuff to build it if you fork.

The Users Manual for the package with several examples can be found [here](http://dyerlab.github.io/gstudio/)

I have started a github account for this package, you can get access to the whole codebase read about it on the wiki, and contribute to the project from its repo at [https://github.com/dyerlab](http://github.com/dyerlab).
