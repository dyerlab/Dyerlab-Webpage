# Background 

This is the stuff that needs to be gone over before we can start being interactive.  

> ... Robert Gentleman and I became colleagues at The University of Auckland. We both had an interest in statistical computing and saw a common need for a better software environment in our Macintosh teaching laboratory. We saw no suitable commercial environment and we began to experiment to see what might be involved in developing one ourselves.

Which resulted in the following email being posted to the s-news listserve on 4 August 1993 by Ross Inhatka and Robert Gentleman in response to a question about getting S running on macintosh computers (they just came out and were quite popular at the time).

## Data & Narrative

What if we can mix the data

```{r}
araptus <- read_csv( "data/araptus.csv")
datatable( araptus )
```



## Data & Narrative 

The spatial distribution of $N =$ `r sum(araptus$Male) + sum(araptus$Female)` individuals were sampled from $K =$ `r nrow(araptus)` sampling sites covered the entire known extent for *Araptus attenuatus* (Figure 1).  On average the sex ratio (Females:Males) within each of the sampling locales varied considerably, ranging from a low of `r min( araptus$Females / araptus$Males )` to `r max( araptus$Females / araptus$Males )`.

```{r fig.cap="*Figure 1:* The spatial distribution of sample locations for the Sonoran Desert bark beetle (*Araptus attenuatus*).", eval=TRUE, fig.align="left"}
library(leaflet) 

leaflet(data = araptus) %>%
  addProviderTiles(provider="Stamen.TerrainBackground") %>%
  addCircleMarkers(weight=1, fill=TRUE, color="#fff") %>%
  addLabelOnlyMarkers(label=~as.character(Site), 
                      labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide=TRUE,
                                                  direction='center',
                                                  textOnly = TRUE))


```

Evidence of differential sex-biased dispersal is revealed by differential structure in biparental and uniparentally inherited genetic markers.  The expectation under equal dispersal betweeen sezes for maternally inherited mitochondrial markers ($F_{ST;mt}$) and biparent nuclear markers ($F_{ST; nuc}$) are (see also Hartl & Clark 1997; Wang 1997 for another formulation):

\[
F_{ST; mt}= \frac{8 F_{ST;nuc}}{1 + 7 F_{ST; nuc} }
\]



```{r echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.minicharts)

leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles( providers$Esri.WorldTopoMap) %>%
  addMinicharts( 
    araptus$Longitude, araptus$Latitude,
    type = "pie",
    chartdata = araptus[, c("Males","Females")],
    width = araptus$Suitability*30
    )

```


## Results

```{r}
araptus %>%
  mutate( SexRatio = Females / Males ) -> araptus

model <- glm( SexRatio ~ log(Suitability), 
              data = araptus,
              family = Gamma() )
summary(model)
```

Female beetles seem to be selecting locales in more suitable habitats (Figure 2), which is consistent with a Gaussian log normal distribution (GLM; intercept = `r summary(model)$coefficients[1,1]`; coef =`r summary(model)$coefficients[2,1]`; P =`r summary(model)$coefficients[2,4]`).  This suggests that males who establish brood chambers at the margins of the species niche are actively selected against by maturing females.

```{r fig.cap="*Figure 2:* Variation in the observed sex ratio of *A. attenuatus* locales as a function of habitat suitability as determined by MAXENT Niche modeling of host plant distributions.", fig.align="left"}
araptus %>%
  ggplot( aes(Suitability, SexRatio) ) + 
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ log(x), 
              method=glm, 
              se=FALSE, 
              color="red",
              size=0.5) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Habitat Suitability") +
  ylab("Observed Sex Ratio (F/M)") +
  theme_minimal() + xlim( c(0,1) ) + ylim(c(0.25,1.75))
```
