## Overview

Welcome to Environmental Data Literacy.   This course is the first in a series of courses from Environmental Studies that focus on developing your quantitative data and geospatial analysis and data communications skills. 

Here you will focus primarily upon developing base R skills that will help you navigate through the general analysis workflow as depicted below.

![Data Work Cycle](/img/classes/edl/DataWorkCycle.png)

The kinds of data we, as environmental scientists, work with is vast and complex.  As such, we must be able to leverage the most advanced approaches to gaining, manipulating, and using these resources for a better **understanding** of the systems within which we work and **communication** of your findings to other scientists and to the public at large. 

Here is a great example.  The data represented below consists of a pair of variables.  In each plot, the mean, standard deviation, and correlation between the variables are identical to two decimal points!  Without visualizing these data sets, you may not be able to make the right decisions (and if you have a star or dinosaur in your plot, we've got to talk!!!)

## Grading Policy

Your overall grade in this class will be determined by homework assignments and exams.  You will have 12 separate homework assignments for this class and three exams.  Both homework and exams are take-home and will be due one week after being assigned.  You may work with colleagues on the homework but your exams must be done on your own.  Because these are take-home activities, they may required a bit more work than can be crammed into a normal 50-minute lecture section.  This is representative of what we do as scientists when we analyze data.  

At the end of the semester, your final grade will be estimated as the percentage of points you were able to harvest as a fraction of the total.  Final grades will be assigned based upon the following categories:  90-100% A, 80-89% B, 70-79% C, 60-69% D, < 60% F.

## Late Policy

You are expected to turn in all work on time; however, late completions are possible if arranged beforehand or in the case of documented illness or emergency.  If you find yourself falling behind, talk to me before you miss a deadline, not after.  If you are going to participate in some research activity (going to a meeting to present, or conducting fieldwork), we can work around these issues and provide alternative solutions to turning in homework.  I am more than happy to work with you on these kinds of experiences.  However, if you are trying to get to spring break on a cheaper plane ticket, you will see I have very little sympathy and given that you have an entire week to complete your assignment and/or exam, that is on you.
